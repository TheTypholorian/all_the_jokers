This is a guide on how to generally install mods via the modloader "Steamodded"/"SMODS", which includes but is not limited to the custom Modpack "GlowyPumpkin"


1. For a guide on how to install the modloader visit: 
   "https://github.com/Steamodded/smods?tab=readme-ov-file#readme" (this is the github of the needed modloader "Steamodded"/"SMODS"
	NOTE THAT for the installation of it you will possibly need to disable your firewall for a short period!
	(how to do that is also described in the github)

2. After successfull installation you just have to extract the .zip modfolder and drag&drop/copy its contents into your new "Mods" folder by going to:
   Win+R -> open "appdata" -> open folder "roaming" -> open folder "Balatro" -> open folder "Mods" -> deposit extracted modfolder



If set up correctly just open Balatro and it should load everything and automatically activate the Mod 
	(if not go to "Mods" in the main menu of the game and Tick box next to the modname)

If there are any troubles or you are unsure about some steps just contact "ButterSpaceship" on the Discord!
