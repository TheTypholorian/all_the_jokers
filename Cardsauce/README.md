**Cardsauce** is a Vinesauce-themed expansion for Balatro, made in collaboration with the Balatro Discord and Vinesauce communities! Featuring art from several talented artists, Cardsauce adds 120 new Jokers, as well as a lot of other new additions to the game.

## Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the latest version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) **(Version 1.0.0~BETA-0711a or later)**. Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.

Once you've installed both lovely and Steammodded, download the latest release zip file from the **Releases** tab and put the folder inside it in your Balatro Mods folder (`%APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods`). That's it! 

***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** **Downloading a zip of the main code may contain WIP content and lead to crashes and/or unfinished work!** We recommend downloading from the latest release.

Detailed credits for everyone else who contributed to the mod can be found in-game in Cardsauce's credits tab in the Mods menu. There are too many names to list here and some credits spoil a bit of the stuff you'll discover in the mod, so just download it and see it all for yourself!
 A huge thank you to all the artists from Artcord Collaberative and the Vinesauce discord who joined the project, your help means the world! ðŸ’š
