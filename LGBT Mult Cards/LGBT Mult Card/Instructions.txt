INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install 7Zip if you do not already have it.
2. Download the mod. This is done in the FILES tab of this modpage.
3. Extract the mod from the zip folder.
4. Go to the Balatro game directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro for windows.) and open Balatro.exe with 7Zip.
5. Navigate to the "resources", and then the "textures" folder so that the folders "1x" and "2x" are visible.
6. Navigate through your mod folder until you reach ...\LGBT Mult Card\Modded and select the folders "1x" and "2x".
7. Drag/Copy-Paste the folders over into the "textures" folder in the 7Zip window.

And you're done!
If you are reverting the game back to its original state you will use the "1x" and "2x" files that are in the "Vanilla" file rather than the "Modded" one.
