# Contributing

You MUST respect the positioning of all existing sprites, and only append onto the sprite sheets in `assets`. DO NOT move existing sprites unless you first update the `pos` attribute for that item. New files MUST have a copyright notice at the top. You SHOULD label the contributions you make to this mod by adding a comment to the top of its entry.

# Branch Info

DO NOT push to main/dev directly, always make a branch/fork, and open a pull request once your changes are finalized. Pull requests SHOULD use dev as their base. You SHOULD name your branches in the following format: `<name>/<change>`. For example: `larry/ghostbusters-joker`. The main branch is for stable releases, and the dev branch is for in-progress work.
