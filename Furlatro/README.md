<img src="gitassets/Splash.png" alt="Splash">

*With 19 unique achievements!*

## Jokers

Furry jokers can only be found from dedicated mod assets

Vanilla-Like jokers can appear like the other vanilla jokers

### Joker Label Structure
<img src="gitassets/Labels.png" alt="Joker Labels" width="500">

The misc rarity label is purely cosmetic and offers no gameplay functionality

## Config

The mod offers a few toggles to mess with

<img src="gitassets/Toggles.png" alt="Config Toggles" width="500">

Toggles that require a restart will take effect on the next boot of Balatro

Toggling the Expanded Poker Hands Toggle will remove effected cards from the collection on boot

### Note: Some Joker quotes have content not meant for younger audiences, please turn off the toggle if you are uncomfortable seeing them, thanks!

## Localization

The mod is English only as of right now, but may have updates to support other languages in a future update!

Localization for other languages that are already implemented into Balatro are already applied to the mod, that being said, if you are a native or bi-lingual speaker
of a certain language (I don't fully trust translation software, etc.), I would love your help on translating entires! This is completely voluntary.

## Contributions

If you're a furry and would like a custom card in Balatro, or anyone that would like to help with localization entries or just wanna follow the mod's development, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/fCnxr4dWfh)!

*Any furry joker contributions may have applicable fine-print, all of this is listed in the discord application process*

And a HUGE thanks to all the lovely beans that allowed me to add them into the mod <3 Any outsource credits are labeled on their respective card!
